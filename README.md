## üö¢ Scenario Introduction

Welcome to the high-stakes, high-seas operations of Coastal Containers Ltd., an international freighting company 
specializing in transatlantic shipping. Coastal Containers is not just your average shipping company; it sits at the 
forefront of modernizing shipping logistics using cutting-edge technology. Despite the prosperous growth of the company, 
however, the high-seas can be an unruly place to conduct business...

### üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è The Challenge

Ahoy! Captain Hashjack and his motley crew of cyber-pirates are sailing the high-seas and have set their sights on our 
precious cargo. These brash brigands are notorious for infiltrating supply ships, not just to loot and leave, but to 
compromise the integrity of our supply lanes and steer ships off their intended course. The menacing members of Captain 
Hashjack's crew could be anywhere, even aboard our own ships, making it impossible to trust anyone out on the open sea!

### üõ°Ô∏è Why Zero Trust?

The mantra of **"Never Trust, Always Verify"** has never been more relevant. To thwart the nefarious plans of Captain 
Hashjack and his crew, Coastal Containers is embarking on a journey to implement a Zero Trust Architecture between its 
HQ infrastructure in the UK and its supply lanes across the Atlantic ocean. This voyage will sail you through a series 
of hands-on labs that will equip you with the skills to:

- Implement robust identity and authentication mechanisms for both users and workloads.
- Create and enforce stringent policies at various layers of our architecture.
- Integrate dynamic security measures that adapt to ever-evolving threats.

By the end of this course, you will have a treasure trove of knowledge and skills to navigate through the perilous 
waters of cyber-threats and begin implementing a Zero Trust model that even the dastardly Captain Hashjack would tip his 
hat to.

So get ready to set sail with Coastal Containers on this Zero Trust Voyage!
